Labeling a suicidal person as “selfish;” “sinful;” or “cowardly” is simply wrong. For a severely depressed person; the pain of existence often becomes too much to bear. Suicide is not a sign of weakness; but of pain. Calling suicide weakness is a sign of ignorance. #StopSuicide,0

UPDATE: A few minutes ago on @wcnc at 11; we told you about a CMPD investigation at Viceregal Ct. CMPD just updated the case. While initially reported as a homicide investigation; police have now ruled it a suicide and a death investigation.,0
@cameron_kasky I may be naive; but I hope the truth will out. Meanwhile; I suspect more people will be “suicide-Ed.”,0

If ever I have to write a dissertation;  it'll be on the stigma of suicide.  The amount of people who physically recoil at that word is just astounding,0
It’s literally suicide atp,0
I want to invest in a good camera and just start doing my own Suicide girl shoots and teach brent how to do it so but he will have none of that so I don’t even wanna bring it up lmao like I just want both of us to get that schmoney and it would be so fun,0
so proud of my sister; Miss Sophomore @Avionnab if you didn’t tune into the Suicide Prevention Training; you definitely missed out !!!!,0
@pattonoswalt Definitely not an overreaction. When you are like me and have lost someone close to a suicide; it is a trigger. We all need help at one time or another. Better to call for help than not and wish you had.,0
sounds like a suicide they found an adult life vest on the boat ??? makes no sense,0
@AFlippinTurtle @HarleyKogane @Ashen_JV @suicidesquadRS Yea Suicide Squad Hell to Pay,0
@twendi66 Keep posting; I have no mad skills myself; although I did make 2 extraordinary children; who then made 5 extraordinary grandchildren; so that’s a talent I guess.  Your art makes me happy; and it appears you’re in MA; the home of my birth!  Go Sox!,0
@jimena20295837 @stoneagett @washingtonpost Volunteer at a mental health facility. Looks at suicide rates. Dr. Phil was weighing positive effects of quarantine VS the effects of locking people; esp children; up for months. LOOK at food bank lines. Listen to folks worry how they’ll feed their families. Stop being nasty.,0

@Marfoogle I hope it slams right into me; no more worries or political bs to deal with would be great! No I am not suicidal just tired of the bs and same crap every day on the news. The white race doesn’t have any privileges over other races. I am just sick and tired of hearing that!,0
If I looked like this I wouldn’t be constantly suicidal,1

I just want to die; forgive me all; but I don’t want to try. I just want to die; to end it all; would really seem so nice. I just want to die; to not wake up; to not be in my life. I just want to die. Please believe; I want the afterlife.,1
Please dont take medical advice from a boozy hag that suicides people as a hobby.,0
@gabedeem @TimothyReigle Good info. Thank you. But saying addiction is exclusively about physical brain changes seems incomplete. It’s like saying that suicide by jumping off a building is about gravity. There are physical realities. But there are moral; non-physical drivers.,0
I just donated 22.00 for the 22 #Veterans that commit suicide each day! Love our Veterans!❤❤❤,0
I seriously want to kill myself more and more everyday.  One day I will have enough courage to do it somehow.,1
@AndromedaMua The next class he proceeded to give all the students his personal number and wrote it on the board and then told everyone what happened and why he wants everyone to have his name in their phone 😂👍🏻 I wanted to dieeeeee I was so embarrassed everyone was looking at me,0
Anxiety.  Depression.  Hopelessness.  Suicidal thoughts.  There are millions of people feeling alone right now.  Invest your words and attention into someone struggling right now.  They need you.  Tomorrow needs you.,0

@danielleglick @afspnational @AASuicidology I am so sorry for your loss.,0
Just heard the comments by Skip Bayless on Dak Prescott’s depression and am completely dumbfounded by both the comments; and Fox for airing them. World Suicide Prevention Day today; and this utter buffoon is telling the world that because Dak is a QB in Dallas; he’s not allowed,0
Idk who i need to hear this but bitch don’t repost no suicide on my TL,0
The government can’t be dumb enough to have Ghislaine suicide herself in the SAME EXACT prison as Jeffrey Epstein right? Like they don’t think we’re that stupid to believe that right?,0
@SpanishLuvSongs is by far my favorite “newish” band that sings about self doubt and how we’re R all stuck in this bullshit together. However @thehotelyear reminds me 2 look out 4 Our friends. A lot of suicides going on right now in my city; and “home like no place there is” hits,0
Someone is always listening. Ready to hear you; to help you fi nf d your way.  #SuicideAwareness  1-800-273-8255,0
Do not censor the word suicide in your tweets because I still know what it fucking means and it's still triggering. That just ensures that it misses my blacklisted words and comes up anyway,0
@raider_claus @NBCNews Stop with the usps being florence nightingale delivering medicine why fighting off bears and lions...oh my!UPS; Fedex and other private co deliver more medicine than the usps can even think of.

Until they get #suicided @RedNationRising @Eagle_eye_rob,0
If your relationship involves a couple  who have well over 40 friends/acquaintances who have suicided or met untimely deaths; it's wise to keep your interactions short &amp;make it clear to all that you love your life! #Epsteindidnotkillhimself,0
GRAPHIC CONTENT ⚠️ In 2020; black men and women are being lynched with no news coverage and they are being ruled as suicides. If you have ever old pictures you can clearly tell this is a lynching. In 2020 😡,0

Catching up on A Million Little Things and was caught off guard when PJ was going to jump off the roof. Triggered memories of my sons suicide attempt. Wow.. major tears. Makes me so sad that people feel so alone.,0
@garrcie Magically better or not have suicidal ideations all the time; im fully aware or that; but its nice to feel supported; esp when the cycle of negative thoughts becomes exhausting. Its good to hear someone say nice things to you; when you only say bad things to yourself,0
I also think his followers are suicidal. You can't blame everything on Trump,0
@MeckCounty 99.98% of 1;077;310 @MeckCounty haven’t perished.  99.993% NOT in a nursing home not died. is this worth BILLIONS lost in NC; suicides; unemployment; depression; missed cancer screenings etc. Ripple affect will be felt 4 decades. #openNC @NC_Governor #openschool @CharMeckSchools,0

@RandolphLaw @SandyDarity And you can ignore that for a sizable number of Americans; they are both the same and thus both need to be rejected. #BULLETORCYANIDE = suicide no matter who is in office. I’m not suicidal to I reject your attempt to Forbes me in your binary thinking,0
"@straightnt_ Nice attempt at a straw man argument though. ""My mental health"" involves anyone that threatens suicide or commits suicide yes. Because I think everyone deserves a chance at life",0

@KanganaTeam People will mental illness are not weak people. Why this is taken as a weakness? 8/10 people in general are depressed; especially these days. Why people think being depressed is so bad? People don’t commit suicide because of depression. They get stronger each time.,0
@MelNeedsAKidney @oexodass @LisaMontana19 @KatiePhang @weijia Life ends in death.  Trump didn’t kill him.  A virus did.  Any virus could have.  Or suicide.  Or violence.  Or a car wreck.    You have my condolences - but it’s not Trumps fault - it is China’s. They lied.,0

@bookkeepPLUS @MattTravisMedia @Ameen_HGA Because it’s what you need to do if you care. Things can change but enough people serious about faith and humanity and eternity are needed. There is a ton to do. Create jobs; get rid of drugs; get back to marriage basics; stop suicide etc.,0
@mikemcmannmd Lockdowns...by far. The residual effects of mass unemployment; suicide; domestic violence; etc will FAR outweigh Covid.,0
@dbongino That is real; Dan. By heart goes out to you for the loss of your friend.  How are his family handling the loss. Check on them with one suicide there may be others. You are one of the best; like your radio show; can't get it everyday but often as possibly.,0

Who made the claim of wanting to commit suicide; stating further that no one would miss him; came into my chat continuing to say these things; @FacebookGaming we as content creators; as well as our moderators need a system where we can actually help these people;,0

@MtnShepherdess @jaredhmoore @NAMICommunicate I was a part of a conversation between 2 ministers about a person who had told one of them that he was going to commit suicide; and then did.   One said; “People who talk about suicide don’t commit suicide.”   The other sad; “That’s right.”   I said; “Well; at least one did.”,0

@OldHick17800719 @eramolop @JoeBiden I love supporting a loving father; beloved husband; accomplished Senator and VP to the second best President I have ever witnessed.  JOE was not friends with Epstein; clueless person; Trump was up until the time he had him suicided. Give it up!,0
@CNNPolitics They do need to go; holding their people hostage. Doctors in California today stated they’re seeking more deaths from suicide than the virus. I would think this will also be the case in Michigan,0

Often suicidal ideation in kids is a result of traumatic events like violence or sexual abuse. It can also be triggered by bullying or cyberbullying. Often; we don’t know kids are struggling until it’s too late. Listen without judgment. Validate their feelings. #StopSuicide,0
@bmoney64wow @ryujincIt Oh no I am suicidal now what have you done,1
I looked him in the face and said sir I self harmed as a teen,0
We’ve all known pain; but consider what it must feel like to be in so much pain; physically or emotionally; that you consider death as the only viable option. An individual contemplating suicide doesn’t need judgement. They need support; connection; and hope. #StopSuicide,0

@serengetisunset @glippiegirl @EM_RESUS @cali_tami How many suicides and deaths due to loss of health insurance are considered acceptable?  This is a genuine question.

@Arachnocat14 He committed suicide,0
✋🏻✋🏻✋🏻my question why isn’t it catching my headlines. I know damn good and well had they been white the cops would be all over it. It’s baffling that supposedly they were all considered suicides; all done by hanging. What was it a Suicide pack; doubtful.,0
@LisaTMullin @CritFacts @ChaosUntold @my_real_name @vb02md @zaelefty I mean those who commited suicide after transitioning; not necessarily due to regretting the decision; but also due to finding their distress has not been relieved by it; or to the outcome not meeting an unrealistic expectation.,0

@GuyChicago5151 Yep; it's only a short matter of time. Before she is left unguarded; with the cameras off. So they can send in the suicide goons; and deliver another BS story to the public. Can I take out a life insurance policy on her? Something that pays triple for questionable circumstances.,0

@nardugg I understand that point. But if everything goes to zero. Famine; crime will all rise substantionally. People would go on drugs; commit suicide. I think that is what will be brought if we let the economy go to zero,0
The Lovestrong series by Susan Hawke is fan-freaking-tastic. I am on the last 2 books of this 6 book series &amp; they’re extremely emotional. Some of the topics covered: bullying; homophobia; PTSD; assault; child abuse; self-harm. So much pain 😭,0

@simonamangiante You're wrong. Economic turmoil leads to increases in suicide; drug use; and crime. Not to mention the poorer a country is the less able they are to deal with epidemics like the Cornoavirus. Hospitals will shutdown; medical innovations will decline; more people will suffer &amp; die,0

@baserunekko @DonaldJTrumpJr In 2017; six-in-ten gun-related deaths in the U.S. were suicides (23;854); while 37% were murders (14;542); according to the CDC. The remainder were unintentional (486); involved law enforcement (553) or had undetermined circumstances (338).,0
Just a small reminder. Don’t do shots for subs or for charity.   Not only can it get dangerous. It can be considered self harm and it is against ToS.  I’ve been seeing this on my timeline again. Please be smarter than this,0

I’m SO sorry for your loss! If people fail to offer comfort it’s not that they don’t feel for you. It’s just that suicide is such a taboo; hard to explain; final behavior.  I don’t know the circumstances BUT DO NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY &amp; BLAME YOURSELF!  Human psyche is complex!,0

@CoreyHowle Suicide is NEVER the correct way. In my opinion; it’s never an option.  In a lot of cases- it’s done outside of ones own willingness.  My post is geared towards debunking the idea that ALL suicides lead to Hell.,0
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: if you haven’t watched someone you love die a slow; painful death; you should keep your opinions about the “sinfulness” of assisted suicide to yourself. As far as the East is to the West; that’s how much you should keep your mouth shut.,0

@_politicsaside @veterans_i I have not demonstrated hate to you I demonstrated understanding of people who said things about a murderer that committed suicide.  Christians are not called to be silent in the face of evil.  We are not called to be happy when people are treated unjustly.  Suicide is a Sin!,0
@BrwnEyedSuicide You wanna fight?,0
Many individuals with serious mental health challenges end up in America’s jails and prisons; where they are at high risk for victimization. Mental illness is not a crime; and jails &amp; prisons are not equipped to be mental health institutions. #StopSuicide #BeHereTomorrow,0

The nightmares. The sudden urges to drink again. The suicidal thoughts creeping back in. I don’t like this at all.,0
@seltzersage At least (hopefully) you didn’t have to sit through hours of videos about management from some old white dude who’s name I cannot remember. I had 3 days 8-5 watching just that. I wanted to die.,0
No. Hope they are on lock down for their protection from a suicide.,0
They said the police who killed #GeorgeFloyd is on suicide watch i personally hope he don’t get the chance to kill himself he deserves to live with the shit he did !!,0

I wrote a blog this morning. I may reactivate my Instagram and Facebook accounts today just to post it. It's a blog about #SUICIDE &amp; I know it's a touchy subject. It's not avoidable though. I have many friends that have or attempted to off themselves.,0

@GrahamCracka07 @CHSommers I can't remember the last time I saw a woman on the Iceboats fishing up crabs; or commiting suicide due to 'just deal with it' thought patterns.,0

@Shermanator_15 My only intention was just to hold the bottom line. I didn’t think he’d right hook me and commit suicide on lap 1. I’m sorry Sherm.,0
@RylanPalmer6 @damanda835 @dewaune_carl @iamcardib yes because 2 people committed “suicide” within 50 miles of eachother; even though the LA County Sheriff even came out and said they were lynched.,0
@1stClown @GalenW15 @Calm_Observer @TheOlifant Any experienced USA cop knows that a shot to the forehead strongly indicates against suicide. But it doesn’t rule it out.,0
If you’re not Islamaphobic by now then you must be suicidal. If you are; go by yourself and stop trying to take everyone with you.,0

@honeyychile Encourages to be done.   Since this has been going on online; you take no pity.   If she had; God forbid; committed suicide from the continued cyber bullying that she has endured; would you still feel the same way?  Mental health in the Black community is a Public Health issue.,0

@DarkLor63881021 @JeffCha83129254 @levitrabeaver @jampacked321 @keiths227 @MMFlint I also think people who die because they can’t get access to medical resources due to the pandemic probably deserve their own category; as do suicides of people who are experiencing financial calamity or have had emotional breakdowns over this.,0
I wouldn't no criminal the heaven start plugging me up auwe I wanted to die and I squel and the other heaven come down and did test and killed that Heaven the other one after it took my blood,0
Thanks to #liberal mayors and Governers who ignore the #Science and intact draconian #shutdowns.  They also are ignoring the increasing deaths rates from drug use; suicide and other untreated diseases as well as the disproportionate impact their action have on #BlackAmericans,0
Youngboy fans on suicide watch rn,0
Of course! @linkinpark are you aware the grifter family took your song for a stupid ad? I’m sure...they just thought since the lead singer committed suicide they’d take the song and not pay royalties? There is no depth to which the trump grifters will go.,0
Pretty bad when suicide surpasses Covid-19 deaths. When in reality suicide has increased due to the lockdowns.,0
@KrazyKaiserHere @derekwatters18 @object_reality @nachosbueno @mollyfprince No. You ever heard of assisted suicide?,0
@HeyItsRuhi So; I deal with it on my own. It’s a hard struggle for me. So the only outlet I have is cutting. I though about suicide a couple of times but I’m to scared to go through with it cause I don’t want to hurt my family or friends,0

How do I tell my parents that their decision to have my penis cut up has made me suicidal; uninterested in sex; and just overall unhappy? My birthday is next week and here I am 26 years later; never gonna be a whole man (even with restoration). #intactivism #mgmismutilation,0
@BleacherReport @thecheckdown I want to die,0
Niggas had me drinking Hen &amp; Patron last night. That’s a suicide mission; I feel real shitty...,0
It is 100% in the wrong to say BLM is more important than suicide awareness. They are both important issues. That’s that “black lives better” @terrycrews warned about.,0
@normalcrab @suicideballoons,0
@SashaGrey Clue - a lot lynch themselves called suicide,0
P2020 vs Gibby is suicide,0
Suicide took 28 times more lives than the virus did. Mosquitoes kill 2;740 people every day; HUMANS kill 1;300 fellow humans every day; and Snakes kill 137 people every day. (Sharks kill 2 people a year) That is all.  STOP FREAKING OUT!!!!,0
I wonder what the suicide rates are going to look like after this pandemic? Dark I know but I just thought about it,0

My boss called me to come bartend for an hour because the news was doing a segment on our job and tell me how they got my ass on tv; no bra; hair thrown up; with no lashes. I’m going to kill myself 🥴😂,0
@AlexWil97790729 He literally is arguing with me about Gravity pulling semen out of a woman's uterus and vagina.... Also asked if I wanted more rope. I'm fucking bulletproof. If I haven't killed myself yet after rape and two kidnappings and 5 robberies; mortgage fraud against me etc... I'm good.,0
I just listened to all 8 minutes and 17 seconds of Suicide Season by Bring Me the Horizon for the first time since the 9th grade..... I’m fine this is fine,0

donald trump is the only person that could actually cause me to kill myself,0

This defense brings back my suicidal thoughts,1
If Trump dies it will be suicide by negligence and hubris,0
Why is 69 trolling and why are ppl feeding into the trolling.....do he want to die or is he going broke and need attention bc i wouldn't be saying a damn thing if I was him; just get my coins and be quiet,0
@WillGalloway_ **** ALLEGED suicide,0
Similar story &amp; sorry for your loss: Remembering being in N Fulton Hosp #ATL watching people in parking lot as their family members died in May. My mom died; suicide; in north fulton hosp (5/15/2020) from paranoia over separation from family &amp; scared  #trumpjoyride  #VoteHimOut,0
~ suicidal thoughts; but i won’t do it ~,1
@LegendaryEnergy I can assure you that they care about the cost. They want it to cost as much as possible. They want us dead. They celebrate every senior citizen on a ventilator; every suicide gives them joy. Every shuttered business is another source of glee.,0
@thebradfordfile Several times over. Look at the bright side....the Clinton’s can’t suicide all of us!,0

@GovKemp What data you are the same idiot who claimed you did not know that asymptomatic individuals could spread the virus. Now you want us to believe in your fake data that only you seem to know about.  Dead man walking. Political suicide @GovKemp,0
Wait... so this nigga Rodman was on suicide watch and the Pistons wanted to trade em?????? They ain’t care about that nigga 😭,0
@Thomas1774Paine @trump_sylvia It’s interesting that almost all the major news reports about this suicide focus on his loans to Trump; but don’t discuss his Epstein connection; even though Epstein also died by hanging only three months earlier. The Trump connection dried up in 2016.,0
im never understood why people tell other people to kill them selves; how much of a evil fuck do you have to be to tell someone to commit suicide. Also why the fuck are you too pussy to murder the person YOU want dead yourself? idk maybe im tripping...,0
felt cute might kill myself later,0

@Convergence_11 @wsbtv Well it wasn’t going to be ruled suicide. They can charge him arrest him but it’s up to the grand jury to go forward. I’m sure you’d know that if you finished school latoya!,0
the real reason kids these days are so addicted to drugs and alcohol and the reason suicide rates and school shootings get higher each decade is because school don’t teach us valuable life skills to be able to cope with our sadness; shortcomings; mistakes; and failures.,0
I’m on the phone w my sister and she just said “Finding Nemo is a lot like my time in the mental hospital. He ends up in this cage due to his own ignorance. He wanted to touch the butt; i wanted to die”,0

#whyididntreport I was 16. It was at a party and I was blackout drunk. He was abusive and left bruises on my arms. His friend could’ve stopped it and he did nothing. My bestfriend at the time sided with my abuser. Suicide attempts seemed easier,0
☝🏽 don’t care about this; already slapped him like i said i would; it’s just funny how life works.  this why i’m such a stickler for being as decent to others as possible; he spent the last year or two cyber bullying other black guys now he eluding to being suic*dal,0

@_politicsaside @veterans_i No Sir it would not; it is nit the same.  GEORGE FLOYD did not cause his own murder and he had commited no crime.  To be overjoyed by the death of an unarmed black man is how racist operate.  Not being upset that a murderer committed suicide is numbness from constant injustices.,0
@tarastrong If you’re involved in the Suicide Squad game we’re not supposed to know about; blink twice.,0
I don’t think it was suicide tbh. It was a cover up cause this scandal goes way up the ladder,0
@2LarryJohnson7 When they kill him under the guise of him committing suicide or overdosing on pain meds; then people will start to embrace his insanity as genius and he’ll be a martyr for truth. Death seems to be the only thing that breaks the media’s spell on people. Temporarily.,0

I was having a mental breakdown when I was living in LA and had the cops called on me because I told someone I wanted to commit suicide. One cop felt me up and claimed he had to check if I had a weapon on me. The way he touched me wasn't routine. He then held my body against his.,0

There is suicide because of long held childhood trauma - and then there is suicide due to fear. Fear of spending life in prison. Now why would that be; we MUST know. American citizens deserve the whole deplorable story. Bastards.,0

@brisky_Suicide Not really. It’s all perspective. In high school; a buddy of mine that I camped with in scouts was 5’ 2”. I was 6’ 3” at the time. It’s totally perspective. Dude looking liked he had some unwieldy monster. I however; with the physicality larger;only looked like I was just average,0

When someone is considering suicide; they don’t need to hear how selfish you think they’re being; or to “just snap out of it”.  Instead; just sit with them and say; “I’m sorry you’re in pain. You’re not alone. You matter. Your life matters.” And then get them help. #StopSuicide,0

@kerpen Holy crap! How many in traffic accidents; suicides; etc?  And if anyone wants to question that I'm a heartless bastard; ask yourself if you were concerned about deaths prior to Covid.,0

@wolfpackJB11 People who deny Creed was lit are lying.  To themselves.  But; it’s social media suicide to admit it openly.  Kinda like saying our fav band is Nickelback.  So; see ya in the next life✌🏼,0
@j_csir @mattklewis @PaulRochford8 The point should be he has failed as a leader for the last 4 years.  Pointing out his failures in an election year is what they are suppose to do; anything else would be suicide.  They have not caused him to fail they are simply reporting it.  What exactly would you have them do?,0

@Ward_L_Shearer @NRA On an occasion where I a suicide attempt is unsuccessful; the chances of another attempt is less than 20%. A gun eliminates all other possibilities by causing an instant death with no other possibility. This same factor elevates arguments and disagreements to lethal events. 1/3,0

@carlmarino1 Multi-degreed. Lived experience. Humbled beyond measure when my now son (former foster son) tried to die by suicide at age 6.  He experienced more trauma than anyone should have to endure. I do what I do for him and so many more who will be villianized as they age.,0
Depression for me is the overwhelming desire to be dead and gone. I'm not suicidal. My brain just tells me I would be better off dead sometimes.   I'm handling this break up lmao,0

@whut_the_whut @PaulBal36517203 @CBSNews Yeah; I agree with you on that point. But; it’s not exactly smart to charge someone with a gun grab the barrel and start jerking it towards you while punching. You can actually cause the gun to fire while it’s pointed at you; essentially committing suicide inadvertently.,0

@goldietaylor @jaketapper Goldie? Are you Ok?   No; dear. Herman Cain failed himself. Not taking precautions in a pandemic is suicide. He committed suicide.   I feel for him and his family; but the “nation” is not to blame. A specific national leader led him—and the nation—astray.,0

@chrisshants @KipHenley Why should we be different? 546 cases in US confirmed.  22 deaths. In comparison;  2000 people died this week of the flu. We are also forgetting cancer; veteran suicide;  and diabetes deaths. Media frenzy should be looked at as a crime.,0
When you’re so used to losing people all the time that’s close to you; it becomes traumatizing; because of the simple fact.. you can lose people &amp; they don’t even have to be dead..that’s why I cherish &amp; love every person close to me.. no matter what have had happened between us.,0

I rather kill myself from boredom,0
@SweatPants2020 @wcnc For your information; the suicide disease is real. My mother had it. It’s when the blood vessel and a nerve in face touch. Some people have it on one or both side of the face. Their were times where my mom could not eat or talk. Watching her suffer was heartbreaking.,0
@SusanStJames3 But this is a deadly virus. Worthy of destruction of much of the economy; a huge surge in public debt; and the inevitable depression and increase in suicides due to the lockdowns to fight it. And Joe can’t leave his basement to debate. Yeah; I’m not feeling it.,0
@CraigCaplan Trump loses votes wherever he holds rallies;  his popularity continues to plummet.  Nobody wants to die b/c Trump needs a narcissistic dose.,0

@DrProudman @cpsuk She abused. While her suicide is tragic &amp; horrific; she was being held accountable for attacking her sleeping partner.

@washingtonpost This take is problematic. First; America and her allies ended his part of that era. It was over and that's why he committed suicide. Second; the war continued with Japan after the German surrender and there were more mass casualties.,0
@CrimeADay Oh! Nobody's dying inpatient. Nope. There will be no suicide this darkest  Holiday Season in Modern History. He doesn't have the balls anyways. Nope. No more pretend-play president; means: Prosecution! The SDNY is beautiful at Christmas time. Even for worthless oxygen thief's. ⚖️,0
You ain’t gotta die to be dead to me,0

@garrcie Ppl can absolutely get suicidal over this. Feelings of loneliness are literally in the checklist for assessing suicide. Maybe some are privileged to have close friends + family but not everyone does. Loneliness; worthlessness + feeling like a burden are all triggers for suicide,0

@NessaSuicide @SaintRPh @Bert_Huggins @BillPascrell Not a fan of Trump but he named zero actual crimes.  He did list off a bunch of vague innuendos with no specifics.

Hope he’s not #Suicided,0
Just in case it’s not crystal fucking clear; if I’m ever found hanging from a tree; it was murder. I would never kill myself that way. I was murdered. If the cops say it was suicide; they fucking did it.,0

Due to very little race specific research; there is insufficient data to definitively explain the rapid increase in Black youth suicides; but we must consider that discrimination; racism; &amp; lack of access to mental health services are contributing factors. #StopSuicide,0

Shame is a universal emotion. And it is painful–perhaps the most excruciating feeling there is; given the sync in the brain like sharp physical pain. The agony makes you want to run; hide or disappear; or say you want to die as if you are a terrible person.,0

@BrianGreenstr16 Many years ago; I went thru depression for about 18 months and had even planned my suicide. I kept praying and a brother told me to get a scripture and go to the Lord every day.

Depression is a liar. It will tell you that you are not enough. Not enough of a friend; husband; wife; sister; or brother. It will tell you that you are unloved and a burden. The truth is you are loved; your life matters; and you are enough; even on your worst day. #StopSuicide,0
